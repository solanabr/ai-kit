# Agents and commands

The complete reference: 15 agents with the model each one runs on, 32 workflow commands, and how to compose them into a team. Nothing here loads up front — Claude Code lists only each agent's and command's one-line description, and reads a body when a task needs it.

## Agents

| Agent | Purpose | Model |
|-------|---------|-------|
| **solana-architect** | System design, PDA schemes, token economics, multi-program architecture | Inherit |
| **anchor-engineer** | Anchor development, IDL generation, account constraints | Opus |
| **pinocchio-engineer** | CU optimization (80-95% savings), zero-copy, minimal binary | Inherit |
| **defi-engineer** | DeFi integrations: Jupiter, Kamino, Raydium, Orca, Meteora | Opus |
| **token-engineer** | Token-2022 extensions, token economics, launch mechanics | Opus |
| **solana-frontend-engineer** | React/Next.js, wallet UX, transaction flows, accessibility | Sonnet |
| **mobile-engineer** | React Native/Expo, mobile wallet adapter, deep linking | Sonnet |
| **rust-backend-engineer** | Axum APIs, indexers, WebSocket services | Sonnet |
| **devops-engineer** | CI/CD, monitoring, RPC infrastructure, Cloudflare Workers | Sonnet |
| **solana-qa-engineer** | Testing (Mollusk/LiteSVM/Trident), CU profiling, code quality | Opus |
| **tech-docs-writer** | READMEs, API docs, integration guides | Sonnet |
| **game-architect** | Solana game design, Unity architecture, on-chain game state, PlaySolana | Inherit |
| **unity-engineer** | Unity/C# implementation, Solana.Unity-SDK, wallet integration, NFT display | Sonnet |
| **solana-guide** | Learning, tutorials, concept explanations, progressive learning paths | Sonnet |
| **solana-researcher** | Ecosystem research, protocol investigation, SDK analysis | Sonnet |

**Model routing:** `Opus` for deep reasoning where Opus is the right fit; `Sonnet` for implementation-heavy, mechanical, docs or high-volume work; `Inherit` means no `model:` line, so the agent runs on your session model (architecture and unsafe low-level code get the strongest model you run, Fable included). The kit never pins `fable`. Commands inherit your session model too, except `/doctor`, `/setup-mcp` and `/scaffold`, which run on Sonnet for that turn: they are mechanical and you run them at the start of a session, where a model switch costs no cached prompt. `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` in your settings `env` sets the model for `Inherit` agents; add `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL_FORCE=1` to apply it to every agent.

## Agent Teams

Each agent loads its own specialized context on invocation:

```
"Use solana-architect to design the vault program"
"Use anchor-engineer to implement the deposit instruction"
"Use defi-engineer to integrate Jupiter swaps"
"Use solana-qa-engineer to write comprehensive tests"
```

Claude will spawn each specialized agent by itself based on context. Agent teams, where several Claude sessions share a task list and message each other, are an experimental Claude Code feature that is off by default, and the kit leaves it off: while it is on, a subagent Claude names can launch as a teammate, which costs more tokens. To opt in, add this to `.claude/settings.local.json`:

```json
{ "env": { "CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS": "1" } }
```

Then ask for a team:

```
"Create an agent team: solana-architect for design, anchor-engineer for implementation, solana-qa-engineer for testing"
```

Recommended team patterns:

| Pattern | Flow | Use Case |
|---------|------|----------|
| **program-ship** | architect → anchor/pinocchio → qa | Build program from spec to tested |
| **full-stack** | architect → anchor → frontend → qa | End-to-end feature |
| **audit-and-fix** | qa → auditor-skill context → anchor | Audit and remediate |
| **game-ship** | game-architect → unity → qa | Game feature |
| **research-and-build** | researcher → architect → anchor/pinocchio | Investigate a protocol or pattern, then design and implement |
| **defi-compose** | researcher → defi-engineer → qa | DeFi integration |
| **token-launch** | token-engineer → frontend → qa | Token creation + launch UI |
